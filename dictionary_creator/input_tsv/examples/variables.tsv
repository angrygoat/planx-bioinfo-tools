diagnosis	lung_localization	Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB): PTB and EPTB diagnosed at the same time. A patient with both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB should be classified as a case of PTB. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) refers to any bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed case of TB involving organs other than the lungs, e.g. pleura, lymph nodes, abdomen, genitourinary tract, skin, joints and bones, meninges. Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) refers to any bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed case of TB involving the lung parenchyma or the tracheobronchial tree. Miliary TB is classified as PTB because there are lesions in the lungs. Tuberculous intra-thoracic lymphadenopathy (mediastinal and/or hilar) or tuberculous pleural effusion, without radiographic abnormalities in the lungs, constitutes a case of extrapulmonary TB. A patient with both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB should be classified as a case of PTB. 	enum	"Pulmonary and Extrapulmonary","Pulmonary"," Extrapulmonary"	No
